Development history:

14-02-2003: (~5 hours)
	    ! Enviroment lighting will need to be looked at
	    * Modified rock meshs so that thire centre is now at the origon
	    + Standard wall sides meshes + textures (had many technical issues that held-up production)

13-02-2003: (~2 hour)
	    ! Bomb incorrect detects that all diamonds have been collected; ~70 were still rememining, and
                 bomb was able to defuse
	    ! Depending on MAP design, visual walls do not have any backs to them
	    + Visual 3D standard wall meshes - started


###  Started effects & final Visual implentaions                           ###
###   (+ coding of any other features missed or need that to be debugged)  ###


10-02-2003: (~2 hours)
	    * Monsters movment is now operational, but not exact
	    * Off-map sections of the screen now correctly how the wall piece (5)
	    + Monsters can now be killed with rocks/eggs

22-12-2002: (~3 hours)
	    + Implement Monsters; needs debugging greately

21-12-2002: (~4 hours)
	    + Funguses can grow; seems very reasonable
	    + Added fungus, skull and barrier
	    * It is now not posible for Repton to not get killed if walking in opposit direct of oncomming spirit
	    + Spirits can now determine which direct they should first be going; this complies with origonal Repton (see tests)
	    + Research; Made MAPs for Repton 3 (origonal) to determine how spirits work; such as starting determination

20-12-2002:
	    + Spirits can now be caught in cage
	    * Spirits now keep formation, only the timer within the last spirit in the array is used
	    ! Spirits do not keep in formation, ie, the same distence between each other; becase they each have thire own timer
	    * Mutiple spirits can now pass each other

18-12-2002:
	    ! It is posible for Repton to not get killed if walking in opposit direct of oncomming spirit
	    ! Multiple spirits can not pass each other (on the same map piece) - design error
	    * Spirits now 'hug-wall-left'

09-12-2002:
	    * Spirits do now not 'eat earth'

02-12-2002:
	    ! Spirits eat earth	
	    ! Design error, spirits do not hug-wall-left, they simply look for a wall in front and turn left if there is
		a wall there
	    + Spirits are now implemented	

14-11-2002:
	    + Detection of Repton dieing by falling a rock or egg
	    + Working on detection of killing Repton (by falling rocks), and detection of cracking egg; both related.
	    + Rocks can now fall right

08-11-2002:
	    ! Rocks now fall left, may need additional work and testing
	    + Rocks now fall left
	    * Jitter bug (while moveing) has now been totally iradicated
	    + Rocks and eggs now fall stright down when not supported (not done left or right falling yet)
	    * Attempted yet again to recreate Repton 3 intro sound in Logic pro audio - much better than other attempts, 
	       also started to add rythem, but this was lost.

27-10-2002:
	    + Repton can now push rocks

26-10-2002:
	    + Rendering of ground; LookUp table for ground type selection ('GetWallAroundInfo', etc)
	    + Ground Art (still need to do ground types > 9)

25-10-2002:
	    + 3D Egg and Rock Art

24-10-2002:
	    * Repton 'animation (engine)' is better - needed to export from MAX at 60 frame res, 
	       also had to change frame selection (* by 160)
	    + Repton now turns to direction of movement
	   */+ Other map graphics to game

23-10-2002:
	    + Bomb can now be defused after all dimonds are cleared
	    ! On some frames a white flash occures
	    + Keys and Safes are now handeled
	    + GUI Dimond counter
	    ! Still pauses when continually moveing 
	    * Made repton movement animation smoother; transition from one to another adjacent place 

18-03-2002:
	    * Attempted to make movment smoother - not succesful

05-03-2002:
	    + Detection of stitic map pieces
	    ! Movment is not very smooth - jitters if continually moving from one piece to another
	    * Repton and cam now moves around map.

02-03-2002:
	    * Minor tweeks; such as B/G and Font colours and moving Repton around map

28-02-2002:
	    + Started work on logical map data

27-02-2002:
	    * Repton can move around level (not logically) - still needs alot of work
	    ! No internal animation on Repton mesh
	    + Displays Repton mesh

09-02-2002:
	    + The 'Visual' based functions in 'cPlayer' - started
	    + Testing of the Repton Returns font
	    * Font file now works in XP, also now includes the Arial Rounded characters
               where Repton based characters have not been allocated

05-02-2002:
	    + Skull Mesh (and mesh bones)
	    + Egg mesh
	   +/* Animation to Repton - started to walk

03-02-2002:
	    * General debug for rendering - now scrolls the map + moves cam

14-12-2001:
	    * Working on rendering (using 'postion and render' method)
	    - 'intihideandshow' and 'hideandshow' function - not needed because of changed rendering method	
12-12-2001:
	    * Reattempted Repton 3 intro sound in Logic pro audio

11-12-2001:
	    * Now displays a 27by30 matrix of '3.x' models with correct intervals

26-10-2001:
            + Attempted to recreate Repton 3 intro sound in Cakewalk

15-10-2001:
	    * Continued work on coverstion.
