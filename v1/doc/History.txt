Repton Returns version 1
Ex-D Software Development(TM)
All rights reserved.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Debug:

Reported    Detail
26-05-2003: Rocks can be pused in free fall when Repton releases a rock and then moves
		down then push the free falling rock

06-05-2003: Dimond sound dosn't play multiple instences; known for a while

14-02-2003: Enviroment lighting will need to be looked at



Possibly fixed:
11-05-2003: Can not kill monster via pushing rock from side
11-05-2003: Error when two Monsters are active (1st to release was top, 2nd was bottom of map; order of which monster is released first may be dependable on different errors. 
30-04-2003: Rocks fall incorrectly, in wrong order
22-03-2003: Monster dosn't die when rock (free) falls on top - rock terminates and monster continues
13-02-2003: Bomb incorrectly detects that all diamonds have been collected; ~70 were still rememining, and
                 bomb was able to defuse


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Do (for BETA):

 Programming:
  Load episode and new level file layouts
  Debugging
  Menu System 
  Play MP3
  Visual FX Class

 Art:
  Monster Art + Animation
  Repton Animation (Upper body walking, digging, being idle, pushing rock, pushing non-movable piece)
  Repton Texture
  Intro Scene
  Spirits
  Bomb

 Sounds:
  Another dimond sound(s); so to recectify 06-05-2003 bug
