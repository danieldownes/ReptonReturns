----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Debug:

Reported    Detail



Possibly fixed:

28-07-2003: After loading a sub-level, the first rock is not inited correctly (position)
10-07-2003: Player dosn't init correctly when transporting to new level (reason for 06-07-03 bug)
06-07-2003: A rock in prelude falls incorrectly
19-06-2003: Still problems with monster killing
26-05-2003: Rocks can be pused in free fall when Repton releases a rock and then moves
		down then push the free falling rock
06-05-2003: Dimond sound dosn't play multiple instences; known for a while
11-05-2003: Can not kill monster via pushing rock from side
11-05-2003: Error when two Monsters are active (1st to release was top, 2nd was bottom of map; order of which monster is released first may be dependable on different errors. 
30-04-2003: Rocks fall incorrectly, in wrong order
22-03-2003: Monster dosn't die when rock (free) falls on top - rock terminates and monster continues
14-02-2003: Enviroment lighting will need to be looked at
13-02-2003: Bomb incorrectly detects that all diamonds have been collected; ~70 were still rememining, and
                 bomb was able to defuse


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Test:

09-02-2005: After playing a game with 4 (or possibly more) sprits, then 
		playing a game with only 3 spirits, a visual spirit was seen
29-05-2003: Monsters now die via funguses


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## To Do (for BETA 2): ##

 Programming:      
  level and game completed screen
  Fountain Partile Engine -- need better particle control; emitting speed, emitter offsetting, particle life control +radius, (clumping?)
	- Repton die
	- monster die
	- egg crack
	- bomb explode
	- spirit capture
	- transporting
	- glittering dimonds
	- Earth digging
	- Dust behind rocks
	- Dust behind monsters, spirts ?
	- Diamond (item) collection?
	- Screen flashing (for egg crack, spirt catch, bomb explode)?
	- other FXs? (warning of overuse)?

  remove directory data from packed files
  (Map View)?
  Dubug file output?
  Editor integration

 review sounds	
 nicer icon
 testing; 	
	Game is Completable?
	Game works for limited user?
	Windows 2000 admin/limited user?	
	Windows 98/ME?
	Timing problems?
		



## Other Ideas ##
  
  Convert to .NET ?
  Secure Files -- Player files to do!

    
 
Episode/Level selector:
    'user levels' selected via a user defined 3x3 map that is merged with 
    episode selector map


Art:
  Repton Animation (pushing rock, pushing non-movable piece)
  More scenery pieces
 
sound effects:

   monster moving 

   squashed by rock 
   die by monster 
   die by spirt 
   die by fungus 
   die by skull         
   cannt push

   completed level		*	- Maybe in B2 ??
   completed game		*
   completed episode

   map colected



new levels? 
   nature 
   food 
In-game save points 
   player can exit level at any time and return to exactly same setup 



show the world RR!!
