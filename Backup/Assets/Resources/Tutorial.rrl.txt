Another element in this game are rocks.

You may push a rock left or right as long as there is room for the rock to move to. You can't push more than one rock at the same time<comma> also you can not push rocks up.

A problem you have.

In order to continue you must get that rock (above) out of the way.

If you do move down the rock you are holding will fall onto you. If you move left or right then the rock will fall and block the passage. You will need to push the rock out of the way as it is falling.

Try moving left and then immediately right<comma> that rock should fit nicely into that space to the right of you. -- This is historically known as 'The Repton Shuffle'.

Funguses will grow to fill all spaces if not trapped behind something. They are deadly on contact.

Collect the diamonds around it and move to a safe position and watch it grow. Make sure you're not too close as it may decide to grow to the space where you are!

Drop some rocks on it to stop it growing.

An egg acts just like a rock only if it falls it will crack and from within a creature will immerge. You must kill it using a rock.

Sometimes there may be no rock readily available. In this case you must let the monster follow you. When you do find a rock the monster shouldn't be too far behind.

Here you should stategically drop a rock on to the monster at the correct time.

Next up are spirits. They must be caught in special cages. A spirit follows the wall to the left of it. It can pass though earth.

Release the spirit and then try to catch it in the cage below - being careful it doesn't enter into Repton.

Some logical thinking required!

Good job!

This is what the game Repton Returns is about

You've completed the tutorial level
now just defuse that bomb!

Remember<comma> all diamonds need to be collected
all monsters need to be irradiated
and all cages will need to have caught a spirit. Also you'll need the crown.

Okay?
